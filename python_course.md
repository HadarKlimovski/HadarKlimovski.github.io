# Basic programming skills (Python)

This year I am taking a [Python course](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-course-2024-04?tab=readme-ov-file) which is a very important computational tool.


The Learning Outcomes from this course will be :
1. Write simple data processing programs in Python
2. Convert files from one format to another format required in scientific environments.
3. Difrantiate between major programming environments.
