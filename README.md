I am a MSc student at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

My research focuses on the vaginal microbiome and its correlation with age, BMI, menopause status, and nutrition.
I am doing this project as part of [Eran Segal's](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/segal/) lab at the Weizmann Institute of Science.
