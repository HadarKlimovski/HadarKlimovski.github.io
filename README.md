### Python course 2024
As part of my MSc I took a Python course, where I learned to make this website in github.
If you want to create a page on github also click on the following link for more information:[python course](/python), also you can view my [assigmnet](https://github.com/HadarKlimovski/HadarsAssignments/tree/main/day02) and get some ideas.
